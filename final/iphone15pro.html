      <img src="images/iphone-15-pro-leaves.jpg">
      <li>The iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to feature an aerospace-grade titanium design. It's also the first iPhone to support USB 3, 6 for faster data transfer speeds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to feature an aerospace-grade titanium design. It's also the first iPhone to support USB 3, 6 for faster data transfer speeds. </p>
      <p>The iPhone 15 Pro measures 5.77 inches (146.6 mm) tall, 2.78 inches (70.6 mm) wide, and 0.32 inches (8.25 mm) thick.</p>
<p>As with the iPhone 14 lineup, the best features are reserved for the iPhone 15 Pro models to make the extra cost worth it, but the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are still very capable devices.

  The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are each available in five color options: pink, yellow, green, blue, and black. Perhaps the most significant change for the lineup is a move from the Lightning port that has been present on every iPhone for over a decade to a USB-C port, although data transfers on these models remain at the same USB 2.0 speeds that were available with Lightning.
  
  New for the non-Pro lineup in 2023 is the Dynamic Island, which debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro lineup a year earlier. The Dynamic Island replaces the previous notch at the top of the display and houses the front-facing TrueDepth camera and other sensors. Software helps hide these physical components inside the black Dynamic Island, which fluidly adapts to display important information and allow for user interaction.
  
  The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus use the same A16 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, using 20 percent less power and delivering improved performance and 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.
  
  Camera improvements include a new 48-megapixel Main camera with a quad-pixel sensor that defaults to capturing 24-megapixel photos. The updated Main camera also allows for a new 2x Telephoto option intelligently cropped from the full camera capture.

    <p>Emergency SOS via satellite debuted with the iPhone 14 lineup, and this year it is expanding to include Roadside Assistance via satellite. Apple is partnering with service agencies such as AAA in the United States to allow users experiencing vehicle difficulties while out of cell signal range to request service, either as part of their AAA membership or on a fee basis.

      The iPhone 15 models are available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities. In addition to wired charging via USB-C, wireless charging via MagSafe and Qi2 is also supported. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus support Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3.
      
      Pricing on the iPhone 15 models remains the same as the previous models, with the standard 6.1-inch device starting at $799 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus starting at $899.
